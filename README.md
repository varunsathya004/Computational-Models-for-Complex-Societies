# Computational-Models-for-Complex-Societies
Netlogo model extending Sugarscape where agents strategically choose between production (harvesting resources) and predation (looting others). Features endogenous role-switching based on payoff calculations, defensive technology, heterogeneous capabilities, and inequality tracking via Gini coefficients. Explores how institutions affect predation.
